I am a Bioinformatics professional with solid experience using software in Linux environments. Currently deepening my knowledge in software testing through theoretical studies, courses, and hands-on projects to showcase and develop my skills.

Bioinformatics Technical Skills:
<p>🔸 Bash/Shell and Python scripting</p>
🔸 Workflow automation scripts (Snakemake and Bash)
🔸 NGS data processing (FastQC, Trimmomatic)
🔸 NGS mapping (BWA, Bowtie, HISAT2)
🔸 Variant calling (GATK, SAMtools)
🔸 RNA-seq analysis – alignment, expression quantification (DESeq2)
🔸 Metagenomics/Metataxonomical analysis (Kraken)
🔸 Genome assembly (SPAdes, Velvet, SOAPdenovo)
🔸 Transcriptome assembly (Trinity)
🔸 NGS file formats (VCF, BAM, FASTQs)
🔸 Genetic data visualization tools (IGV)
🔸 GUI-Based NGS Analysis (Galaxy)
🔸 Databases (NCBI, Ensembl, PDB, ClinVar, KEGG, Gene Ontology)

QA Technical Skills:
🔹 Know how to analyze and write SQL queries
🔹 Understand QA fundamentals and testing methodologies
🔹 Write and maintain detailed test cases and test plans, and document results with clear reports
🔹 Familiar with SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) and STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
🔹 Capable of writing clear and comprehensive bug reports
🔹 Track, analyze, and report issues using tools like Jira and TestRail, offering insights to support bug resolution
🔹 Experienced with Git and GitHub for version control and terminal commands
🔹 Strong analytical and communication skills, with attention to detail
🔹 Knowledgeable in Python and JavaScript

Recently, I published a Manual Testing Project on GitHub that demonstrates a structured approach to quality assurance. It includes test plans, test cases, and defect tracking — all carefully documented to reflect real-world scenarios.
