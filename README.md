## Hi, I'm S√©rgio de Alencar

I am a Bioinformatics scientist transitioning into QA Engineering, bringing strong analytical skills and a meticulous approach to software testing. I have solid knowledge of QA fundamentals, SDLC, and STLC, with hands-on experience in test planning, writing comprehensive test cases, and documenting results through clear, actionable reports. I am proficient in SQL for backend validation, experienced with Jira, TestRail, Git/GitHub, and API testing using Postman. My background includes mobile testing, basic web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), and a strong focus on precision, collaboration, and product quality.
